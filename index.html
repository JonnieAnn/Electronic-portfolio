<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Jonnie-Ann Cadet. I'm a senior at Waipahu High School and I grew up in Waipahu, Hawaii. Since I was a child, I've been very involved with electronics growing up. I have been studying Cybersecurity throughout all of my Highschool years and I aim to pursue a computing job in the future, protecting companies from hackers. My present goal is to graduate cum laude in May 2025. </p>
