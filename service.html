<h2> <a href="https://www.east2westam.com/"> East 2 West Acupuncture and Massage</a> | June 2023 - August 2023</h2>
<p>During the summer before my Junior year, I worked at East 2 West Acupuncture and Massage as a Receptionist. Working there, I had a chance to learn how to communicate with customers on the phone to schedule their next visit. I also advanced my computer skills by sending gmails everyday and keeping up to date with important events. I provided a clean and safe environment for both my co-workers and customers. </p>

<h2><a href="https://mrcowcorndog.com/"> Mr.Cow</a>/<a href="https://www.dippindots.com/"> Dippin' Dots</a> | December 2023 - Present</h2>
<p>Since December 2023, I have been alternating between Mr. Cow and Dippin' Dots as a cashier. Working on both sides has taught me how to multitask by doing two different jobs at once. I've learned how to manage the register and count the cash at the end of each day. </p>

<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<p>One of my hobbies would be self care. My favorite part of the day is when I get to do my skincare every morning and night. I also follow up with protective hairstyles that'll ensure my hair is in its best state for the upcoming days. I prioritize my health by exercising regularly and being physically active. Although self care isnt a common hobby, it has taught me how to put my health first which is something that I enjoy doing. </p>
